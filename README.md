# Projects
A project is a type of assignment, typically involving research or design, that is carefully planned to achieve a specific objective.[1]

An alternative view sees a project managerially as a sequence of events: a "set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations".[2]

A project may be a temporary (rather than a permanent) social system (work system), possibly staffed by teams (within or across organizations) to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints.[3]: Section 1.2 [4]

A project may form a part of wider programme management[5]: 1  or function as an ad hoc system
